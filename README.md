## Overview

This repository contains a simple CRUD application that enables users to manage a list of items. The application is built using popular web technologies, including React for the frontend, Redux for state management, and Redux Saga for handling asynchronous operations.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized to maintain clarity and modularity:

- `public`: Contains public assets and the `index.html` file.
- `src`:
  - `components`: React components for the user interface.
  - `redux`: Redux-related files, including actions, reducers, and sagas.
  - `sagas`: Redux Saga middleware for handling asynchronous operations.
  - `stores`: Redux store configuration.
  - `styles`: Stylesheets for styling components.
  - `App.tsx`: Main application component.
