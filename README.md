# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple CRUD application that enables users to manage a list of items. The application is built using popular web technologies, including React for the frontend, Redux for state management, and Redux Saga for handling asynchronous operations.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized to maintain clarity and modularity:

- `public`: Contains public assets and the `index.html` file.
- `src`:
  - `components`: React components for the user interface.
  - `redux`: Redux-related files, including actions, reducers, and sagas.
  - `sagas`: Redux Saga middleware for handling asynchronous operations.
  - `stores`: Redux store configuration.
  - `styles`: Stylesheets for styling components.
  - `App.tsx`: Main application component.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the CRUD application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crud-react-redux-saga.git
   cd crud-react-redux-saga
   ```

## Installation

To install the dependencies for the CRUD application, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Running the Application**
   To run the application, use the following command:
   ```bash
       npm run start
   ```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing a list of items. Key features include adding, updating, and deleting items. The initial list of items is fetched from a mock API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) upon application load.

## Project Dependencies

The CRUD application relies on the following technologies:

- React
- Redux
- Redux Saga
- Bootstrap (for styling)

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and features of the CRUD application. Follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add your feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature`.
5. Submit a pull request.
